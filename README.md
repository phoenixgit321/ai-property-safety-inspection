# AI-Assisted Property Safety Inspection App

This project is an AI-for-Good application designed to help users understand property safety risks in a simple and accessible way.

The app allows users to search for properties and view safety insights such as risk levels, inspection patterns, nearby context, and an AI-generated plain-language safety summary.

## Problem
Property safety and inspection data often exists but is difficult for non-technical users to understand. Important risks are usually discovered only after serious issues occur.

## Solution
This app transforms existing inspection data into:
- Visual risk insights
- Clear KPIs
- Plain-language AI explanations using Snowflake Cortex

The goal is to improve awareness and support better decision-making for tenants, buyers, and regulators.

## Technology Stack
- Snowflake (data storage and processing)
- Streamlit in Snowflake (interactive UI)
- Snowflake Cortex (AI-generated safety summaries)
- Altair (data visualization)
- Python

## AI for Good Impact
The solution improves transparency, accessibility, and early awareness of property safety risks while using AI responsibly to explain—not replace—human judgment.
